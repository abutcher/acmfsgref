      <para>
	Chris orders pizza for our club meetings. Know the
	room, time, and estimated number of attendees before
	contacting Chris. Be sure to grab plates/cups from him
	before he leaves on meeting day.

	Dr. Brian Woerner &lt;brian.woerner@mail.wvu.edu&gt;
      </title>
      <para>
	Dr. Woerner is the department chair. If there is ever a
	time we need money for an event and our speaker's topic
	would benefit the rest of the department, then it is
	time to ask Dr. Woerner if the department can cover
	travel expenses for our speaker. We are notorious for
	having no money so this happens a lot for big speakers.

	Karen Grimm &lt;karan.grimm@mail.wvu.edu&gt;
      </title>
      <para>
	Karen handles finances for the club when Dr. Woerner has
	agreed to finance us. A travelling speaker needs to give
	Karen an invoice for their travel and she will handle
	the rest.
