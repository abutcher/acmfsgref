      <para>
        Chris orders pizza for our club meetings. Know the
        room, time, and estimated number of attendees before
        contacting Chris. Be sure to grab plates/cups from him
        before he leaves on meeting day.

        Dr. Brian Woerner &lt;brian.woerner@mail.wvu.edu&gt;
      </title>
      <para>
        Dr. Woerner is the department chair. If there is ever a
        time we need money for an event and our speaker's topic
        would benefit the rest of the department, then it is
        time to ask Dr. Woerner if the department can cover
        travel expenses for our speaker. We are notorious for
        having no money so this happens a lot for big speakers.

        Karen Grimm &lt;karen.grimm@mail.wvu.edu&gt;
      </title>
      <para>
        Karen handles finances for the club when Dr. Woerner has
        agreed to finance us. A travelling speaker needs to give
        Karen an invoice for their travel and she will handle
        the rest.

        Chris Southard recorded the audio and video for the Richard
        Stallman lecture. He also was able to do live webcasts. Contact
        him with plenty of lead time if you want to have an event
        recorded.

        <para>
          His servies are not free. You will need to procure the
