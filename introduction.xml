      This guide contains information pertaining to managing WVU ACM and
      FSG student organizations. Everything you need to do as part of
      your job as a club officer should be documented here.  If you come
      across something that is not documented, then document it.  If you
      come across a piece of information that is incorrect in this
      document, then correct it!

      This guide is rendered into HTML and PDF formats from a
      collection of well-formatted XML documents. The XML source
      complies to the DocBook V5.1 (or newer) schema.

      Eric S. Raymond writes about DocBook (and the reasons you should
      use it) in his book, <link
      xl:href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch18s05.html">The
      Art of Unix Programming</link>. In summary: DocBook lets you
      spend less time fiddling with what your document looks like
      (bold, indented, numbered or bulleted lists?), and spend more
      time on what your book says. When writing DocBook you describe
      the contents of your document. Then, when you're finished, a
      toolset transforms the XML sources and produces uniformly styled
      HTML and PDF documents. The presentation-level work is all done
      for you.
