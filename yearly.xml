	<emphasis role="bold">Freshman EngineerFEST</emphasis>, occurs around the
	second week of classes. The point of this event is to spark
	interest in joining ACM to incoming freshman. The chair of the
	club will most likely receive an email about booking a table
	for Freshman EngineerFEST. If they don't, then be sure to ask
	around Freshman Engineering. Be sure to bring a sign up sheet
	so that new students can jot down their emails. It's also a
	good idea to bring an info sheet so that students can read a
	little bit more about the clubs and check out our site. Make a
	big poster if you have time.

	<emphasis role="bold">First Meeting</emphasis>, the first meeting is
	listed because it sets the tone for the rest of the semester.
	More people are going to come to this meeting than any other
	meeting. This meeting should occur soon following Freshman
	EngineerFEST.  Follow meeting protocol and everything will be
	great.  Be sure to re-iterate what the club is about and have
	a banging speaker for this meeting.
