  <para>
    If you're reading this then you are now an officer (or should be)
    in the WVU ACM or FSG.
  </para>

  <para>
    You're not only a part of one of the most active and successful
    clubs on campus, you're taking a role in leading it. In just two
    years we were able to take a club of humble origins and turn it in
    the club to be watched on the Engineering campus. We're in the
    business of making things happen and you will be too.
  </para>
  <para>
    In just the past several years, we've hosted events such as
    Richard Stallman's talk on Copyright, John Perry Barlow's
    discussion on political unrest in the Middle East, and Corey
    Haines Test-Driven Development code retreat. Through FSG, we were
    able to get free alternatives installed in campus computer labs.

  <para>
    As an officer of ACM &amp; FSG, you have a responsibility to keep
    the fire burning; to keep organizing awesome events that engage
    students and get them asking questions. Perhaps you'll change
    their point of view or introduce them to ideas that change their
    lives.
